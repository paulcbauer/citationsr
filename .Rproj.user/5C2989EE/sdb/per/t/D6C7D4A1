    "contents" : "# Citations\nThe R package 'citations' comprises functions that can be used to analyze citation cases, i.e. citations within documents that cite a particular (or several) studies. These functions would normally be executed in a sequence.\n\n1. `extract_text()`: Extract text from citing documents (PDFs) and saves text in text files with the same name. \n1. `identify_citing_doc()`: Identifies citing documents (PDFs) either by finding a DOI and querying information using that DOI or by trying to extract title, journal, pages etc. from the PDF itself.\n2. `identify_study_doc()`: Runs through citing documents and identifes whether study of interest was really cited in there, i.e. whether it appears in the references. Produces a table with the extracted reference (if there has been) to the study.\n3. `delete_ref_section()` and `delete_running_heads()`: Clean up .txt files of citing documents (omitting/deleting reference section and running heads) to facilitate citation case extraction. \n5. `clean_text()`: Clean .txt files (e.g. replace abbreviation) to facilitate citation case extraction.\n8. `extract_citation_cases()`: Extract citations cases from citing documents (.txt files). \n9. Analyze the extracted citation cases: to be continued...\n\n* `clean_pdf_filenames` and `numeric_to_name` are unfinished functions. The former shall rename PDF files with problematic names. The latter shall convert citing documents from the numeric to the name citation system.\n\n\n# How to...\n\n## Prerequesites\n\n* You need to install xpdf into the folder C:\\Program Files\\xpdf\n\n## First steps\nInstall/load the package.\n```{r, echo=T, eval=F}\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"paulbauer/citations\")\nlibrary(citations)\n```\n\nSet working directory to folder that, in turn, contains folders (e.g. \"Beck 1995\", \"Tumasjan 2010\") or just a single folder that contain(s) the citing documents (PDFs) for particular studies. Later on you specify the respective subfolders in the function.\n```{r, echo=T, eval=F}\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/paul/Google Drive/Research/2016_Quality_of_citations/data\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Example: A single study (analyze 20 documents in folder)\n```{r, echo=T, eval=F}\n# Omit number = 20 if the functions should run across all documents.\nextract_text(folder = \"Beck 1995\", number = 20)\nidentify_citing_doc(folder = \"Beck 1995\", number = 10)\nidentify_study_doc(study.title = \"What to Do (and Not to Do) with Time-Series Cross-Section Data\",\n                 folder = \"Beck 1995\"#\n                 ,  number = 20)\ndelete_ref_section(folder = \"Beck 1995\", number = 20)\ndelete_running_heads(folder = \"Beck 1995\", number = 20)\nclean_text(folder = \"Beck 1995\", number = 20)\nextract_citation_cases(folder = \"Beck 1995\",\n                         authorname = \"Beck, Katz\",\n                         studyyear = \"1995\",\n                         number = 20) # , scope = 2\n```\n\n\n\n## Example: Several studies\n* Information on studies should be saved in a  table.\n* Then we can loop over the content in the table.\n\n```{r, echo=T, eval=F}\n\npublicationdata <- read.table(\"publicationdata.txt\", sep=\";\",\n                                header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)\n\n  for (i in 1:nrow(publicationdata)){\n\n    folder <- publicationdata[i,1]\n    study.title <- publicationdata[i,2]\n    authorname <- publicationdata[i,3]\n    studyyear <- publicationdata[i,4]\n\n    # extract_text(folder = folder)\n    # identify_study_doc(study.title = study.title, folder = folder)\n    # delete_ref_section(folder = folder)\n    # clean_text(folder = folder)\n    extract_citation_cases(folder = folder, authorname = authorname, studyyear = studyyear)\n\n  }\n```\n",
