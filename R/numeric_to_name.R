# how to identify whether citing document uses numeric citation system
  # count [3] in text?
  # Identify the structure of references (after word references appears), i.e. count [2] in the references or the numbers
    # There has to be a consecutive series of numbers in there

# Get citation cases
    # go into the references, identify the number of the citation and subsequently search text that belong to those numbers
    # Problems.. other [] that are not citations - replace them before? (e.g. if they don't contain a number)


# Make a function that replaces the numeric system with the classic system?! Is that possible?
    # split references so that they are properly readable, extract authornames and years
