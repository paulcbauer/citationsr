# citationsr
The R package 'citationsr' shall comprise functions that can be used to extract and analyze citation cases, i.e. citations within documents that cite a single or several studies.


## Install
```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("paulcbauer/citationsr")
```

## Working with the citationsr package
Please read the [introductory vignette here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/paulcbauer/citationsr/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.html) or use the following link:  https://github.com/paulcbauer/citationsr/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.html!

## Flaws...
* Extracting citation cases when the references/identifier are located in footnotes does not work
* Extracting citations cases for a numeric citation system does not work (bascially that would require going into the references to identify reference belonging to a certain number)
